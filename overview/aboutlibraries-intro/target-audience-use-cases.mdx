# Target Audience & Typical Use Cases

## Who Should Use AboutLibraries?

AboutLibraries is designed to empower a broad spectrum of developers and organizations by automating the discovery, attribution, and compliance of open-source libraries within their projects. If you fall into any of the following groups, AboutLibraries will significantly streamline your workflow and reduce the complexity of managing third-party dependencies.

- **Android Developers:** Whether building apps targeting standard Android devices or leveraging Jetpack Compose UI toolkits, AboutLibraries seamlessly integrates into your Gradle build process, automatically scanning dependencies for license and metadata information.

- **JVM Developers:** If you develop Java or Kotlin libraries and applications that rely on external dependencies, AboutLibraries provides an automated solution to collect and report licenses without manual overhead.

- **Multiplatform Developers:** Kotlin Multiplatform projects, including iOS and desktop targets, benefit from AboutLibraries’ support across platforms, enabling consistent license metadata collection and attributions across your entire codebase.

- **Compose UI Developers:** For those creating modern UI with Compose (Android Compose, Compose for Desktop, or Compose Multiplatform), AboutLibraries offers ready-to-use Compose UI components to effortlessly visualize third-party library information within your apps.

- **Teams Focused on License Compliance:** Development teams responsible for ensuring legal adherence across software projects can rely on AboutLibraries to automatically detect and flag usage of licenses, helping avoid compliance risks and audit failures.

- **Organizations Managing OSS Visibility:** Enterprises and open-source advocates wanting to promote transparency can utilize AboutLibraries to build clear, user-facing attributions and legal documentation automatically, supporting both brand trust and internal governance.

## Typical Use Cases

### 1. Ensuring App Store Compliance

App stores like Google Play require explicit display of third-party licenses and attributions. Manually tracking dependencies is error-prone and time-consuming. AboutLibraries automates this by:

- Scanning all Gradle dependencies at build time.
- Collecting license metadata and funding information.
- Providing UI components or raw metadata output to embed in your app.

This guarantees your app package complies with app store policies without extra runtime performance costs.

### 2. Building Legal Documentation for Third-Party Libraries

Legal teams need accurate, up-to-date documentation of the open-source licenses your apps rely on. AboutLibraries enables you to:

- Export formatted license metadata in JSON or other consumable formats.
- Include comprehensive license texts, developer, and funding information.
- Define strict license policies that fail builds on unauthorized licenses, ensuring license compliance proactively.

This supports internal audits, open-source policy governance, and public transparency.

### 3. Transparently Displaying OSS Usage to End Users

For user-facing applications, transparent license attributions increase trust and compliance visibility. AboutLibraries provides:

- Prebuilt Compose UI components to embed a fully featured library and license overview inside your app.
- Easy customization for appearance and content to match your app’s branding.

Developers can focus on core functionality while ensuring users have clear visibility into the open-source components used.

### 4. Automating Dependency Metadata Collection in Complex Multiplatform Projects

Managing dependencies across Android, JVM, iOS, desktop, and web targets can be overwhelming. AboutLibraries helps by:

- Supporting Kotlin Multiplatform setups with consistent metadata collection.
- Centralizing license and library information to prevent discrepancies between platforms.

This automation simplifies governance and reporting in modern polyglot projects.

### 5. Enforcing Licensing Policies During Continuous Integration

Teams aiming to enforce legal boundaries can:

- Configure strict mode to reject builds including unapproved licenses.
- Customize allowed licenses and exceptions per project or dependency.

This reduces risks of non-compliance slipping into releases and automates compliance enforcement.

### 6. OEMs and Large-Scale Organizations Managing Hundreds of Dependencies

Large organizations often embed numerous open-source projects and submodules. AboutLibraries assists by:

- Automatically merging and managing duplicate licenses.
- Linking related dependencies for clearer attributions.
- Providing centralized tooling integrated into Gradle builds.

This scalability helps reduce manual labor and license tracking errors at scale.
