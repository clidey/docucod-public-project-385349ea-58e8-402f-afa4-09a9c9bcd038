# Product Value & Benefits

Discover how AboutLibraries transforms the way you manage third-party dependencies by automating license metadata collection and presentation. This page highlights the core benefits that make AboutLibraries indispensable for developers seeking legal compliance, transparency, and efficiency.

---

## Delivering Legal Compliance with Confidence

Maintaining proper software license compliance can be daunting and error-prone when done manually. AboutLibraries simplifies this critical task by:

- Automatically collecting comprehensive license and attribution information for all Gradle dependencies.
- Enabling strict license enforcement policies that detect and alert on disallowed licenses during builds.
- Providing full license texts for embedded display, ensuring clear legal transparency.

This automation drastically reduces risks related to inadvertent license violations, safeguarding your projects and your organization.

## Transparency That Builds Trust

End-users and stakeholders increasingly demand visibility into the open source components their software uses. AboutLibraries meets this demand by:

- Embedding detailed third-party library metadata directly into your app without runtime performance impact.
- Displaying clear attributions, developer information, and funding sources through customizable UI components.
- Supporting Material You Design (Compose Material3) to integrate naturally with modern user interfaces.

Transparency not only enhances user trust but also positions your product as responsible and respectful toward open source contributors.

## Automation that Saves Developer Time

Manually tracking licenses and library information is a tedious, error-prone overhead. AboutLibraries automates this process end-to-end:

- Gradle plugin scans dependencies at build time to collect and collate library metadata.
- Outputs structured JSON files that can be easily integrated into multiplatform projects, including Android, desktop, and even WebAssembly.
- Supports incremental builds with strong Gradle caching, making repeated metadata collection efficient and fast.

Save countless hours by letting AboutLibraries handle what it's built for—accurate and reliable metadata automation.

## Robust Multiplatform and UI Support

AboutLibraries is built with modern development needs at its core:

- Seamless integration with Kotlin Multiplatform projects, covering Android, Desktop JVM, and WASM JS targets.
- Compose UI support for both the legacy Compose Material and the latest Compose Material3, providing flexible, themed components for license displays.
- Enables developers to customize UI components while still benefiting from reliable metadata.

This expansive support future-proofs your app across platforms and UI paradigms.

## Eliminate Manual Dependency Tracking

Tracking dependencies in multiple places invites inconsistencies and vulnerabilities. AboutLibraries centralizes this by:

- Managing dependency metadata within your build process automatically.
- Eliminating the need for manual attribution text or external license tracking spreadsheets.
- Providing a single source of truth that is tightly coupled with your actual build dependencies.

Reduce errors and minimize compliance headaches through automation and integration.

## Real-World Impact

Imagine building an Android app that incorporates dozens of open source libraries. Without automation, you must painstakingly verify each license type, copy legal text, and manage attributions — a process prone to mistakes and delays.

With AboutLibraries, you configure a Gradle plugin once. At every build, it fetches accurate, up-to-date license and developer information, packaged directly into your app’s About screen. You enforce license policies that block disallowed licenses early, preventing costly compliance issues down the line.

This workflow delivers peace of mind, improved legal safety, and frees your team to focus on building features.

---

## Tips for Success

- Define a strict license policy upfront in your AboutLibraries Gradle plugin configuration to prevent unauthorized license usage early.
- Utilize AboutLibraries’ Compose Material3 components to elegantly present license and funding information, improving user experience.
- Leverage the Gradle caching and offline modes to speed up builds and reduce external dependencies during CI runs.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Ignoring License Updates:** Regularly refresh your dependency metadata to capture any license changes upstream.
- **Overlooking Funding Information:** Enable funding collection to recognize and honor supporting developers properly.
- **Neglecting Multiplatform Setup:** Ensure all target platforms include AboutLibraries resources and plugin configurations to avoid missing data in builds.
