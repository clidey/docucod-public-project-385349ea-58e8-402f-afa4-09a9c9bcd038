# Modifying Library, License, and Funding Information

This guide empowers you to take full control over the metadata AboutLibraries generates for your third-party libraries. By injecting or editing JSON configuration files, you can add missing libraries, override detected licenses, track custom funding sources, and enforce license policies. This customization ensures your app’s attributions are accurate, complete, and compliant.

---

## Workflow Overview

### What You Will Achieve
- Learn how to augment or replace auto-generated library, license, and funding information.
- Manage metadata via JSON files to correct missing data or enforce organizational policies.
- Customize tracking for obscure or internally developed libraries outside of automatic detection.

### Prerequisites
- Generated `aboutlibraries.json` metadata file (from the Gradle plugin’s export task).
- Basic understanding of JSON syntax and file editing.
- Access to your app’s resource folder where configuration can be placed.

### Expected Outcome
- A set of JSON configuration files that AboutLibraries can merge with or override default metadata.
- Correct, policy-compliant, and custom metadata visible in your app’s library attribution UI.

### Time Estimate
15–30 minutes for initial setup; variable depending on number and complexity of overrides.

### Difficulty Level
Intermediate – requires JSON editing and familiarity with the library metadata domain.

---

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Locate Your Generated Metadata
- Verify the presence of the `aboutlibraries.json` file generated by the Gradle plugin.
- Typically this resides in your app’s generated assets or raw resource folders.

### 2. Understand Metadata Structure
- The JSON includes libraries, licenses, developers, funding, and organizational information.
- Each library entry combines fields like `uniqueId`, `name`, `licenses`, `funding`, and more.
- Licenses include fields such as `name`, `url`, `spdxId`, and optional `licenseContent`.

<Tip>
You can inspect sample metadata by checking the exported JSON file mentioned in the [Exporting Dependency Metadata](https://your-docs/guides/getting-started/exporting-metadata) guide.
</Tip>

### 3. Prepare Your Custom JSON Overrides
- Create a JSON file (e.g., `custom-libraries.json`) that includes libraries or edits to existing ones.
- Format it consistent with the AboutLibraries data model, including fields such as:
  - `uniqueId`: Library’s unique identifier (same as in the original metadata to override).
  - `name`: Library display name.
  - `licenses`: An array of license objects with name, url, spdxId, year, and hash.
  - `funding`: Optional funding platforms with URLs.
  - `developers` and `organization`: For author or organization attribution.

```json
{
  "libraries": [
    {
      "uniqueId": "com.example.mylib",
      "name": "My Custom Library",
      "licenses": [
        {
          "name": "Custom License",
          "url": "https://example.com/custom-license",
          "spdxId": null,
          "year": "2024",
          "hash": "123456abcdef"
        }
      ],
      "funding": [
        {
          "platform": "Patreon",
          "url": "https://patreon.com/example"
        }
      ],
      "developers": [
        {
          "name": "Jane Doe",
          "organisationUrl": "https://janedoe.dev"
        }
      ],
      "organization": {
        "name": "Example Org",
        "url": "https://example.org"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

<Tip>
Use the hash field in licenses to uniquely identify licenses, especially if you include full license texts.
</Tip>

### 4. Place the Override File for Runtime Loading
- Add your custom JSON file into your app’s assets or resources where AboutLibraries runtime loader can find it.
- The exact integration point depends on your platform and loading strategy (refer to your setup’s loading documentation).

### 5. Merge or Override Metadata at Runtime
- AboutLibraries supports merging your custom metadata with auto-generated data.
- If an entry with the same `uniqueId` exists, your custom data will override or augment the auto-generated entry.

<Tip>
Check your app’s runtime loading code to ensure multiple JSON sources are combined—for example, initial plugin-generated data plus your overrides.
</Tip>

### 6. Validate Your Changes
- Run your app and open the libraries attribution UI.
- Confirm your customized library details (names, licenses, funding) appear correctly.
- Verify no conflicting or duplicated entries exist.

<Tip>
If custom licenses do not render properly in dialogs, ensure your license content or URLs are correct and complete.
</Tip>

## Examples & Configuration Patterns

### Custom Library Addition Example
Add an internal or private library that does not appear automatically.

```json
{
  "libraries": [
    {
      "uniqueId": "com.yourcompany.private:secretlib",
      "name": "SecretLib",
      "licenses": [
        {
          "name": "Proprietary License",
          "url": null,
          "spdxId": null,
          "year": "2024",
          "hash": "abcdef123456"
        }
      ],
      "developers": [
        { "name": "Your Company Dev Team", "organisationUrl": "https://yourcompany.com" }
      ],
      "organization": {
        "name": "Your Company",
        "url": "https://yourcompany.com"
      },
      "funding": []
    }
  ]
}
```

### License Override Example
Replace an incorrect SPDX license or add full license text.

```json
{
  "licenses": [
    {
      "name": "Apache License 2.0",
      "url": "https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt",
      "spdxId": "Apache-2.0",
      "year": "2024",
      "licenseContent": "Full license text here...",
      "hash": "uniquehashvalue12345"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Troubleshooting & Best Practices

### Common Issues

- **Custom metadata not showing in UI**: Check that your JSON file is loaded correctly and merged at runtime. Verify paths, file naming, and loading logic.
- **Duplicated libraries or licenses**: Ensure `uniqueId` fields are consistent and that overrides are correctly targeted.
- **Incorrect license rendering**: Validate that license hashes match the license content if provided, and URLs point to valid license texts.
- **JSON syntax errors**: Use JSON validators to avoid malformed files causing silent ignores.

### Best Practices

- Always keep a backup of your original generated `aboutlibraries.json`.
- Use consistent `uniqueId` values matching those in the original metadata for overrides.
- Prefer overriding only necessary fields to minimize maintenance as dependencies update.
- Document your custom JSON files clearly in your repo.
- Regularly regenerate base metadata and verify that your overrides remain compatible.

### Performance Considerations
- Keep your override files concise to avoid increasing app size unnecessarily.
- Avoid embedding very large license texts unless essential; use URLs where possible.

### Alternative Approaches
- Consider integration via build-time merging of JSON files if runtime merging is complex for your setup.
- Use AboutLibraries’ API (e.g., `Libs`) if you need dynamic programmatic metadata updates instead of static JSON.
