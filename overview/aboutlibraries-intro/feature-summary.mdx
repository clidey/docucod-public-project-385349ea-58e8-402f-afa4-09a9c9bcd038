# Feature Overview

Explore the major capabilities that make AboutLibraries an indispensable tool for managing third-party dependencies and licenses in your projects. This page offers a straightforward, benefit-driven review of AboutLibraries' core features, focusing on how they empower you to automate compliance, visualize library data, and customize license handling with ease.

---

## Core Features at a Glance

### 1. Gradle Plugin Automation
AboutLibraries integrates deeply into your build process through its Gradle plugin. This automation automatically detects all your project’s dependencies and collects comprehensive metadata, including license details, requiring zero manual effort.

**Benefits:**
- Saves extensive manual tracking of libraries and licenses.
- Ensures up-to-date and accurate license metadata for every build.
- Eliminates runtime overhead by resolving all data during build time.

---

### 2. Multiplatform and Compose UI Modules
AboutLibraries offers dedicated UI components tailored for modern multiplatform development, especially with Jetpack Compose:

- **Compose UI Modules**: Visualize library information seamlessly within your app using Compose-based components compatible with Material 2 and Material 3 design systems.
- **Multiplatform Support**: Enables consistent license presentation and metadata across Android, iOS, and other supported platforms.

**Benefits:**
- Provides a polished, native-like experience for users inspecting third-party licenses.
- Allows easy customization of UI elements while maintaining compliance transparency.

---

### 3. Comprehensive Access to Generated Metadata
The metadata generated by AboutLibraries about your dependencies is made fully accessible through a well-defined core library API:

- Access metadata about libraries, their licenses, developers, funding info, and source control.
- Leverage this data for custom reporting or integration into your own compliance workflows.

**Benefits:**
- Empowers developers to build tailored license disclosures.
- Supports integration with Continuous Integration (CI) environments or custom tooling.

---

### 4. License Strict Mode
To safeguard legal compliance, AboutLibraries includes a "strict mode" feature that enforces license acceptance policies:

- Automatically flags disallowed or incompatible licenses within your dependencies.
- Helps prevent accidental inclusion of libraries that violate your legal or organizational policies.

**Benefits:**
- Reduces legal risk through automated compliance enforcement.
- Provides peace of mind by highlighting problematic libraries early.

---

### 5. Support for Custom Overrides and Funding Links
Not all library metadata can be perfectly inferred. AboutLibraries enables customization and enhancement:

- Override library or license information manually to correct inaccuracies.
- Add custom funding links to recognize and support open source maintainers.

**Benefits:**
- Keeps metadata accurate even for edge cases.
- Lets you promote open source sustainability by surfacing funding options.

---

### 6. Legacy View-Based UI Module (Deprecated)
For backward compatibility, AboutLibraries still offers a legacy UI module based on the classic Android View system:

- Provides built-in activities and fragments to display libraries and license information.
- Suitable for existing apps not yet migrated to Compose.

**Important:** This module is deprecated and limited to essential maintenance. Full migration to the Compose UI modules is strongly recommended.

## Real-World Context: How Features Solve Your Challenges

Imagine you're preparing to release an app with dozens of third-party dependencies. Manually gathering license info, ensuring compliance, and presenting it clearly would be tedious and error-prone. AboutLibraries:

- Automatically detects every dependency and extracts accurate license and author info without manual effort.
- Integrates smoothly into your existing Gradle build, so you don’t change your workflow.
- Lets you embed elegant license displays within your app using modern Compose UI, improving user trust.
- Enforces your compliance policies at build time, preventing risky libraries from slipping in.

---

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Enable License Strict Mode Early:** Activate strict mode during development to catch license issues proactively.
- **Leverage Metadata API:** Use the core API to create custom license reports tailored to your organization’s needs.
- **Migrate Away from Legacy UI:** Transition to Compose UI modules for better maintainability and modern look-and-feel.
- **Use Overrides Wisely:** When overriding metadata, document your changes to keep track of customizations.

---

## Summary
AboutLibraries offers a robust suite of features centered around automation, transparency, and customization:
- Gradle plugin automates dependency and license detection.
- Compose UI modules provide modern, multiplatform visualizations.
- Core API grants access to rich metadata for integration.
- License strict mode enforces compliance policies.
- Custom overrides and funding links enhance metadata accuracy.
- Legacy view-based UI remains available but deprecated.

Harness these features to streamline license compliance workflows, save developer time, and build user trust with clear third-party attributions.
