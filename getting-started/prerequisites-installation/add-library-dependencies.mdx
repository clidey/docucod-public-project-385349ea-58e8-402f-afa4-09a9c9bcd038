# Add AboutLibraries Core & UI Dependencies

This guide explains how to include the necessary AboutLibraries core and UI modules in your project. You will learn how to use the recommended version catalog (`libs.versions.toml`) or direct Gradle dependencies. It also covers selecting UI modules for different platforms and choosing between Compose Material2, Material3, or the deprecated legacy view-based UI to ensure your app has the right setup.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

Before adding AboutLibraries dependencies, ensure:

- You have a Kotlin Multiplatform or Android project using Gradle.
- The AboutLibraries Gradle plugin is installed (recommended but not mandatory).
- You have access to Maven Central or your Maven repository hosting AboutLibraries artifacts.

<Tip>
Using the [version catalog (`libs.versions.toml`)](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/platforms.html) is the best practice for managing AboutLibraries dependencies efficiently and consistently across your project.
</Tip>

---

## 2. Including Dependencies via Version Catalog

The recommended approach is to define AboutLibraries dependencies in your `libs.versions.toml` file. Here is how to declare the core and UI modules:

```toml
[versions]
aboutLibraries = "{latest-version}"

[libraries]
# Core module (access generated library data)
aboutlibraries-core = { module = "com.mikepenz:aboutlibraries-core", version.ref = "aboutLibraries" }

# Compose UI modules (select one or both)
aboutlibraries-compose-core = { module = "com.mikepenz:aboutlibraries-compose-core", version.ref = "aboutLibraries" }  # Common Compose core
aboutlibraries-compose-m2 = { module = "com.mikepenz:aboutlibraries-compose", version.ref = "aboutLibraries" }       # Material 2 UI
aboutlibraries-compose-m3 = { module = "com.mikepenz:aboutlibraries-compose-m3", version.ref = "aboutLibraries" }    # Material 3 UI

# Deprecated View-based UI module (not recommended)
aboutlibraries-view = { module = "com.mikepenz:aboutlibraries", version.ref = "aboutLibraries" }

[plugins]
aboutLibraries = { id = "com.mikepenz.aboutlibraries.plugin", version.ref = "aboutLibraries" }
```

### Add to build.gradle.kts

Use the following in your module's `build.gradle.kts` file to add dependencies:

```kotlin
// Add the core module
implementation(libs.aboutlibraries.core)

// Add Compose UI modules (choose either Material 2 or Material 3 or both)
implementation(libs.aboutlibraries.compose.m2) // For Material 2 UI
implementation(libs.aboutlibraries.compose.m3) // For Material 3 UI

// If using legacy UI (deprecated)
// implementation(libs.aboutlibraries.view)
```

<Tip>
Choose **one** of Material 2 or Material 3 Compose UI modules to match your app's design system for consistency. You can include both if your app uses a mix, but it's not recommended.
</Tip>

---

## 3. Including Dependencies via Direct Gradle Declaration

Alternatively, add dependencies directly in your Gradle module files if you do not use the version catalog.

### Core Module

```gradle
implementation("com.mikepenz:aboutlibraries-core:{latest-version}")
```

### Compose UI Modules

```gradle
// Material 2
implementation("com.mikepenz:aboutlibraries-compose:{latest-version}")

// Material 3
implementation("com.mikepenz:aboutlibraries-compose-m3:{latest-version}")
```

### Deprecated View-based UI (Legacy)

```gradle
implementation("com.mikepenz:aboutlibraries:{latest-version}")
```

<Warning>
The legacy view-based UI is deprecated and will be removed in future releases. Migrating to the Compose UI is strongly recommended.
</Warning>

---

## 4. Choosing the Compose UI Modules

AboutLibraries provides several UI options to integrate seamlessly with Compose-based UIs:

- **Material 2 UI (`aboutlibraries-compose`)**
  - Stable, classic Material Design UI components.
  - Best suited for projects still on Material 2 design.

- **Material 3 UI (`aboutlibraries-compose-m3`)**
  - Latest Material You design components.
  - Recommended for projects using Jetpack Compose Material3.

- **Compose Core UI (`aboutlibraries-compose-core`)**
  - Common shared compose components used internally.
  - Usually included transitively but can be added explicitly.

<Tip>
Include only the UI module(s) that match your project design system to avoid conflicts and unnecessary dependency size.
</Tip>

---

## 5. Adding Dependencies for Multiplatform Projects

The core and Compose UI modules support Kotlin Multiplatform targets including Android, Desktop (JVM), WASM, iOS (via Compose Native), and JavaScript.

Make sure to define dependencies correctly under the respective `sourceSets` in your `build.gradle.kts`. For example:

```kotlin
kotlin {
    androidTarget()
    jvm("desktop")
    wasmJs {
        browser()
    }
    iosX64()
    iosArm64()
    iosSimulatorArm64()

    sourceSets {
        val commonMain by getting {
            dependencies {
                implementation(libs.aboutlibraries.core)
                implementation(libs.aboutlibraries.compose.m2) // or .m3
            }
        }
        val androidMain by getting
        val desktopMain by getting
        val wasmJsMain by getting
        val iosMain by creating {
            dependsOn(commonMain)
        }
    }
}
```

## 7. Example Gradle Snippet

Here is a minimal example for an Android Compose project using version catalog:

```kotlin
// build.gradle.kts
plugins {
    id("com.android.application")
    kotlin("android")
    id("com.mikepenz.aboutlibraries.plugin")
}

android {
    // Your Android config
}

dependencies {
    implementation(libs.aboutlibraries.core)
    implementation(libs.aboutlibraries.compose.m3) // Using Material 3 UI
}
```

## 8. Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Common Dependency Issues">
<Accordion title="Dependency Not Found or Failed to Resolve">
- Confirm your repository includes Maven Central or JCenter.
- Verify your version catalog defines the correct version.
- Try to refresh Gradle caches (`./gradlew --refresh-dependencies`).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Conflicting Compose UI Modules">
- Avoid including both Material 2 and Material 3 UI modules unless absolutely necessary.
- Conflicts in compose dependencies can cause build errors or runtime UI issues.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Legacy UI Module Deprecated Warning">
- Migrate to Compose UI modules.
- Use [ComposeView](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/interop/compose-in-views) for interoperability if mixing View and Compose.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
