# Feature Highlights & Improvements

Discover the most impactful features and improvements introduced in every major and minor release of AboutLibraries. This page offers a clear, concise overview of enhancements—from broad multiplatform support to Compose UI advancements—helping you quickly understand what's new and leverage the latest functionality with minimal effort.

## 1. Evolution of Multiplatform Support

AboutLibraries has steadily expanded its compatibility across platforms, empowering you to easily integrate license and dependency data regardless of target environment.

- **Android:** Continuous improvements solidify native Android support, ensuring seamless integration with Gradle and Android build systems.
- **Desktop:** Support for JVM desktop targets using Compose Desktop enables rich, native-like experiences beyond mobile.
- **iOS:** Inclusion of iOS frameworks facilitates license metadata usage on Apple devices.
- **WASM and JavaScript:** Experimental support for WebAssembly and JavaScript broadens integration possibilities for web and cross-platform apps.

These expansions unlock new use cases and deliver consistent user experiences across your entire app ecosystem.

## 2. Compose UI Enhancements

The Compose UI integration has seen significant growth, reflecting user demand for better, customizable visualizations.

- **LibrariesContainer & LibrariesScaffold:** Refined composables offer flexible layout and interaction patterns for presenting dependency and license data elegantly.
- **Customization:** New capabilities enable overriding default components such as library names, license tags, and funding badges to align with app branding.
- **Preview Tooling:** Enhanced tooling support makes it easier to preview changes in development environments, speeding up UI design iterations.
- **Theming and Styling:** Robust theme options empower you to customize colors, dimensions, typography, and shapes, creating a cohesive design.

These improvements streamline incorporating open source notices into your app’s UI with an emphasis on user-friendly interfaces and adaptability.

## 3. Enhanced License Compliance Features

Maintaining legal compliance is paramount, and AboutLibraries continues to strengthen tooling around licenses.

- **Strict Mode Enforcement:** Automatic build failures occur if unauthorized licenses are detected, allowing early remediation.
- **Fine-Grained Controls:** Customizable allowed license lists, including per-dependency overrides, give precise compliance management.
- **Remote License Fetching:** Optional enrichment using GitHub API enhances license accuracy and coverage.
- **Duplication Handling:** Smarter rules for linking or merging duplicate licenses and libraries avoid redundant entries, simplifying reports.

These features mitigate risks, assuring that license usage aligns with your organization's policies.

## 4. Gradle Plugin and Build Process Improvements

The Gradle plugin central to AboutLibraries' automation continues to evolve for better reliability and integration.

- **Flexible Output Configuration:** Define multiple output targets for library metadata JSON files across various source sets and native targets.
- **Variant Filtering:** Export metadata specific to desired Gradle build variants, optimizing build artifacts.
- **Offline Mode:** Disable remote data fetching during exports to improve build stability and repeatability.
- **Duplication & Filtering Rules:** Configurable modes and rules reduce conflicts and manage dependencies smartly.
- **Support for Multiple Compose Versions:** Support is extended for Compose Material 2 and 3 libraries, accommodating diverse project needs.

These changes simplify your build pipeline and ensure metadata is both accurate and efficiently generated.

## 5. Real-World Use Case: Creating a License Display Interface

Imagine an app developer preparing an Android and Desktop app to display third-party notices:

1. **Generate Metadata:** Using the Gradle plugin, the developer exports `aboutlibraries.json` tailored to each target
1. **Runtime Loading:** Compose UI functions like `rememberLibraries` load this metadata dynamically
1. **Render UI:** Using `LibrariesContainer`, the app displays an interactive, searchable list of libraries with licenses and funding information
1. **Customize UI:** The developer overrides components to match app branding and adds dialog details for licenses
1. **Ensure Compliance:** Strict mode triggers build failure on unapproved licenses, enforcing policy automatically

By following this flow, the developer delivers legally compliant, visually attractive attribution with minimal manual effort.

## 6. Troubleshooting and Best Practices

Effectively leveraging these features means adopting these best practices and addressing common issues:

- **Validate Plugin Setup:** Confirm Gradle plugin configuration includes correct paths and variant filters for intended platforms.
- **Preview UI Changes:** Use Compose tooling previews frequently during UI customization to confirm results.
- **License Lists:** Maintain accurate allowed license collections in your build script to prevent unexpected build failures.
- **Metadata Regeneration:** Regularly update metadata to capture changes in project dependencies.
- **Handling Duplicates:** Use duplication rules to merge related libraries and avoid clutter in UI displays.
